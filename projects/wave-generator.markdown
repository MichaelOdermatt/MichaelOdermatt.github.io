<h3>Wave Shape</h3>
<p>Uses Gerstner Waves and a layered noise map (Fractal Brownian Motion) to create the wave shape.

<h3>Whitecaps</h3>
<p>The whitecaps were created by taking the Y component of each surface normal, multiplying it by the normalized height of each associated vertex, then evaluating that value along a gradient. This strategy for creating whitecaps is fast, simple, and gives a good amount of freedom in coloring the waves. With it I was even able to add a middle semi-teal tone to the gradient which almost gives the appearance that the wave is using some form of light scattering.
