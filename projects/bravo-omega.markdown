## What is it?
Bravo Omega is a game I made for the ‘2019 Game by its Cover’ Game Jam that took me roughly a month to complete. The main focus of the gameplay was exploration
with some occasional 'events' (a short text based segment where you had to make decisions on how you would proceed) and very simple puzzles.
