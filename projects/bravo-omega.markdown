## What is it?
Bravo Omega is a game I made for the '2019 Game by its Cover' Game Jam. It took me roughly a month to complete. In the end I was proud of the game overall, but I realized I failed in a pretty important part of the game's design, to actually make it fun to play. Because of this I wasn't satisfied enough with Bravo Omega to submit it into the game jam. However, looking back I think I was too harsh on myself and still see value in the project. It's still not very fun to play but to me the idea was interesting and had I more experience maybe I could have actually made it worth playing.
