title: Star Marcher
---
Star Marcher is a small game that offers 25 levels, providing a simple and yet hopefully engaging experience. Although sound is not currently incorporated, the game thrives on its primary objectiveâ€”to showcase my abilities in C# and Unity development. Furthermore, this project serves as an exciting addition to my ever-growing list of projects.
