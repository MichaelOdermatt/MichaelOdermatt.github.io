title: Star Marcher
---
Star Marcher is a mechanically simple game with only 25 levels and no sound as of writing this, though that may change down the line. My main purpose for making it was to exercise my skill with C#, Unity, and hopefully add another interesting project to my portfilo.

The game turned out pretty good dispite some levels feeling a bit too hard. One really small detail I like about the game is the contradiction between the art style and the mechaics. The game is set in space so you would expect space-like gravity (being pulled toward planets and being able to throw yourself off in any direction and float away indefinitely in that direction), but you don't get that, instead gravity behaves just like earth, as if you were a man swinging between buildings.
